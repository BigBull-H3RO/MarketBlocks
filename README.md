# MarketBlocks

## Overview

MarketBlocks is a Minecraft mod for the NeoForge mod loader that introduces a simple and intuitive player-driven economy. It allows players to set up their own shops using a special "Small Shop Block" to trade items with other players on a server.

## Features

*   **Player-Owned Shops:** Craft and place a Small Shop Block to start your own business. The player who places the block becomes its owner.
*   **Create Trade Offers:** Owners can set up a trade by specifying up to two payment items and one result item. For example, you can sell 1 Diamond for 64 Iron Ingots.
*   **Secure Transactions:** Only the owner (and any players they add as co-owners) can manage the shop's offers and inventory.
*   **Item Automation:** The shop block can interact with adjacent chests (or other inventories) to automatically pull necessary items for sale and push payment items into storage.
*   **Customizable Shop:** Set a custom name for your shop that appears in the UI.
*   **Redstone Integration:** The shop can emit a redstone signal upon a successful trade, allowing for integration with other redstone contraptions.

## How to Use

1.  **Craft a Small Shop Block:** (Recipe to be defined, but it's the central block of the mod).
2.  **Place the Block:** Place it in the world. You are now the owner.
3.  **Open the UI:** Right-click the block to open its interface.
4.  **Set an Offer:** Place the items you want to sell (result) and the items you want to receive as payment in the designated slots.
5.  **Stock Your Shop:** Add the items you are selling to the shop's input inventory. You can do this manually or by placing a chest next to the shop and configuring the side to "Input".
6.  **Collect Payment:** Payments will be stored in the shop's output inventory. You can also configure a side to "Output" to have them automatically moved to an adjacent chest.

This mod provides a seamless way to create a thriving market economy on your Minecraft server. Happy trading!
